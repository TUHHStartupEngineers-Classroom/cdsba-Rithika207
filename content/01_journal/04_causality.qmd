# Assignment

Creating fictional example of a spurious correlation. Suppose we want to show a correlation between the average global temperature and the number of pirates over the years.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(456)

# Generate fictional data
years <- seq(1900, 2020, by = 10)
global_temperature <- 14 + 0.02 * years + rnorm(length(years), mean = 0, sd = 1)
number_of_pirates <- 5000 - 20 * years + rnorm(length(years), mean = 0, sd = 1000)

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(Year = years, GlobalTemperature = global_temperature, Pirates = number_of_pirates)

# Plot the spurious correlation
ggplot(data, aes(x = GlobalTemperature, y = Pirates)) +
  geom_point(color = "green") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Spurious Correlation: Global Temperature vs. Number of Pirates",
       x = "Global Temperature (Â°C)",
       y = "Number of Pirates") +
  theme_minimal()
```

In this example, I've generated fictional data where the number of pirates decreases as the global temperature increases. The geom_smooth function adds a linear regression line to the plot, creating the appearance of a correlation.
